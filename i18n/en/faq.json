        "category": "About Avenqor",
        "question": "Is Avenqor a broker, prop firm or signal provider?",
        "answer": "No. Avenqor is an educational platform. We do not execute trades, manage client funds, provide trading signals, copy trading, PAMM/MAM services or any form of portfolio management."
      },
      {
        "category": "About Avenqor",
        "question": "Do you guarantee any profit or performance?",
        "answer": "No. Trading Forex, Crypto and Binary options is highly speculative and can lead to substantial or total loss of capital. We do not guarantee any outcome, return, win rate, payout, drawdown or similar metric. Our content is for education only."
      },
      {
        "category": "Courses & content",
        "question": "What format are Avenqor courses delivered in?",
        "answer": "Courses are delivered as structured PDF documents. Each course is organised into modules, key concepts, examples and practical checklists so that you can study at your own pace."
      },
      {
        "category": "Courses & content",
        "question": "What is the difference between a ready-made course and a custom course?",
        "answer": "Ready-made courses are pre-built learning paths by market and level (Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced). A custom course is created specifically around your inputs: experience, deposit size, risk tolerance, preferred markets and goals. It follows a similar PDF structure but is tailored to your situation."
      },
      {
        "category": "Custom course",
        "question": "How does the custom course process work?",
        "answer": "You complete a short form with your experience level, deposit size, risk tolerance, markets, trading style and goals. After payment, we prepare a tailored PDF course and send it to your email within an estimated 48–96 hours. The course is educational and does not contain trading signals."
      },
      {
        "category": "Custom course",
        "question": "Why does a custom course take 48–96 hours?",
        "answer": "The time window reflects the process of reviewing your inputs and structuring a course that matches them. It is not instant like an AI strategy. The 48–96h range is approximate and can vary depending on demand and complexity."
      },
      {
        "category": "AI strategy",
        "question": "What is an AI strategy inside Avenqor?",
        "answer": "An AI strategy is an instantly generated plan that describes setup criteria, entry/exit logic, and a risk checklist based on your inputs. It is not a live signal or an auto-trading system. It is educational material intended to help you think in structured scenarios."
      },
      {
        "category": "AI strategy",
        "question": "Can I treat AI strategies as trade signals?",
        "answer": "No. AI strategies are not trade signals, recommendations, or personalised financial advice. They are examples of how a structured plan could look. You are fully responsible for any trades you take in your own account."
      },
      {
        "category": "Tokens & payments",
        "question": "How do tokens work on Avenqor?",
        "answer": "Tokens are an internal balance that you can use to unlock courses, custom PDFs and AI strategies. You can load tokens by purchasing token packs or by setting a custom top-up. Tokens are not a separate financial product or investment."
      },
      {
        "category": "Tokens & payments",
        "question": "Can I pay directly without using tokens?",
        "answer": "Yes. In many cases you can pay directly in your local currency (for example EUR, GBP, USD or AED) for a single course or product. In that case, tokens are not required for that purchase."
      },
      {
        "category": "Tokens & payments",
        "question": "Which currencies and payment methods do you support?",
        "answer": "Supported currencies in the interface include EUR, GBP, USD and AED. Specific payment methods (for example card brands or local processors) can vary by region and will be shown at checkout."
      },
      {
        "category": "Access & account",
        "question": "Do I need an account to access Avenqor courses?",
        "answer": "You can browse course descriptions without an account. To purchase courses, request a custom course, generate AI strategies or manage your token balance, you will need to create an account and sign in."
      },
      {
        "category": "Access & account",
        "question": "Where can I see the courses and strategies I have already purchased?",
        "answer": "After signing in, you will find your purchased courses, custom PDFs and AI strategies in your dashboard. From there you can open PDFs, review past AI outputs and see your recent activity."
      },
      {
        "category": "Risk & regulation",
        "question": "Is Avenqor regulated as a financial services provider?",
        "answer": "Avenqor is positioned as an education-only platform and does not provide execution, investment services, portfolio management or payment services for trading accounts. As such, it does not operate as a broker or investment firm. Always check our Terms & Conditions and Risk & Disclaimer for the most up-to-date legal classification."
      },
      {
        "category": "Risk & regulation",
        "question": "Who is responsible for the trades I decide to take?",
        "answer": "You are. Any decision to trade in Forex, Crypto or Binary options is your own responsibility. Avenqor does not know your full financial situation, objectives or constraints, and nothing on the platform should be treated as personalised advice."
